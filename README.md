# Custom Boilerplate: Bonne Nuit

## About This Repository

This repository is a custom version of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), tailored with the author's specific tastes in mind to be used as a basic starting point for any future HTML projects. Minimal CSS in the form
of SASS is added for design purposes, as well as personal icons and Open Graph meta tags.

## Features

* Built off of the basis of the HTML5 Boilerplate, a comprehensive starting point for modern HTML projects.
* Adds the functionality of SASS and Node.js for further customization.
* Has a base index page that uses Flexbox layout through SASS for easy modular webpage structure.

## Documentation
