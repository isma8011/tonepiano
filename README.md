## About This Repository

This repository is a project based on a custom version of [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/), tailored with the author's specific tastes in mind to be used as a basic starting point for any future HTML projects. While the original custom boilerplate uses SASS, this one only uses CSS.

## Features

* Tone.js
* Pure CSS
* Based on my own [Custom Boilerplate](https://github.com/isma8011/customboilerplate)

## Documentation

Take a look at the [documentation table of contents](docs/TOC.md). This
documentation is bundled with the project which makes it available for offline
reading and provides a useful starting point for any documentation you want to
write about your project.

## Contributing

The majority of this custom boilerplate code comes from the [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
Github repository. It provided the basis of the file structure, as well as the overall skeleton of the project.
Cloning the original repository is recommended for those who want a blank template of the boilerplate. Piano key design
and keyboard functionality contributed by David Schaal.

## License
